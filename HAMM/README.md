# HAMM â€“ Counting Point Mutations

This project solves the **HAMM** problem from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/hamm/), which involves computing the **Hamming distance** between two DNA strings.

## Problem Description

Given two DNA strings of equal length, the **Hamming distance** is the number of positions at which the corresponding bases are different.
