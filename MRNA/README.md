## ðŸ“Œ Problem Description

Given a protein string, determine the total number of different RNA strings from which the protein could have been translated. Because this number may be enormous, return the answer modulo **1,000,000**.

Every amino acid can be encoded by multiple RNA codons. Additionally, each valid RNA string must end with a **stop codon**, of which there are 3 possible choices.
