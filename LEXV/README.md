# ðŸ§¬ Rosalind Problem: Ordering Strings of Varying Length Lexicographically (LEXV)

This repository contains my solution to the [LEXV problem on Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/lexv/), which involves generating all possible strings of **varying lengths** from an ordered alphabet, sorted **lexicographically**.

---

## ðŸ“š Problem Description

Given:
- A **permutation** of up to 12 symbols representing an **ordered alphabet** \(\mathcal{A}\)
- A positive integer \(n \leq 4\)

Return:
- All strings of length **at most** \(n\) that can be formed from \(\mathcal{A}\), ordered **lexicographically**, based on the order given in the input (not necessarily standard dictionary order).
