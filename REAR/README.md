# 🧬 Rosalind Problem: Reversal Distance (REAR)

This repository contains my solution to the [REAR problem on Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/rear/), which involves computing the **minimum number of reversals** required to transform one permutation into another—also known as the **reversal distance**.

## 📚 Problem Description

### 🔁 Reversal
A **reversal** of a permutation inverts the order of a contiguous subsequence.  
For example, transforming:

### 🧩 Problem Statement

**Given:**
- Up to 5 pairs of permutations of length 10

**Return:**
- For each pair, the **reversal distance**: the **minimum number of reversals** required to transform the first permutation into the second
