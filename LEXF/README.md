# ðŸ§¬ Rosalind Problem: Enumerating k-mers Lexicographically (LEXF)

This repository contains my solution to the [LEXF problem on Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/lexf/), which involves generating all possible strings (k-mers) of a given length from an ordered alphabet, **sorted lexicographically**.

---

## ðŸ“š Problem Description

Given:
- A collection of **symbols** defining an **ordered alphabet** (max 10 characters)
- A positive integer **n** (with \( n \leq 10 \))

Return:
- All strings of length **n** that can be formed from the given alphabet, listed in **lexicographic order**.

> Lexicographic order here means dictionary order, respecting the custom order of symbols in the given alphabet.
