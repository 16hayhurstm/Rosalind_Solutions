# ðŸ§¬ Rosalind Problem: LIS â€“ Longest Increasing Subsequence

## ðŸ“– Problem Description

Given a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`, the goal is to find one of the **longest increasing subsequences (LIS)** within that permutation.

A **subsequence** is a sequence derived by deleting zero or more elements from the original sequence without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## ðŸ§  Approach

This solution uses a **recursive algorithm with memoization** (top-down dynamic programming):
