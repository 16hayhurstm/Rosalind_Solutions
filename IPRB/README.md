# ðŸ§¬ Rosalind Problem: Mendelâ€™s First Law (IPRB)

This repository contains my solution to the [IPRB problem on Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/), which requires computing the **probability** that two randomly selected organisms will produce an offspring displaying a **dominant** allele.

## ðŸ§® Problem Overview

- **Given:** Three integers \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\), representing a population of \(k + m + n\) organisms:
  - \(k\): number of homozygous dominant (AA)
  - \(m\): number of heterozygous (Aa)
  - \(n\): number of homozygous recessive (aa)

- **Task:** Calculate the probability that two randomly chosen parents (without replacement) will produce an offspring with at least one dominant alleleâ€”i.e., exhibiting the dominant phenotype.

- **Assumptions:** Any two organisms are equally likely to mate.
